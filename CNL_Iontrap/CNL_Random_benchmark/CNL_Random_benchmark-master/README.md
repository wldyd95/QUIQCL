# CNL_Random_benchmark
This module is used for random benchmarking test of quantum gates(using microwave)
For random benchmarking, changing microwave phase is needed.
In this module, we save 8 phase values in FPGA registers and select phase using 3 swithces of sequencer FPGA.
By doing benchmarking with random phase, we can measure gate fidelity of quantum gates.
